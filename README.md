## Minted
These slides use minted for the code block samples. As documented [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/563919/34690), the package `python3-pygments` needs to be installed.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pygments
```

## Playing videos
Open the presentation with

```bash
pdfpc main.pdf
```

## GIFs
Maybe the simplest way to get GIFs working could be to play it as a video. See [https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/444127/34690](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/444127/34690).
